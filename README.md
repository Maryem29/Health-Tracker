## Comments
<p>⋆˚｡⋆୨୧˚ I really like how the project turned out in the end I think for my next health_tracker application I would like to make it a bit more personalised and interactive. I want to use HTML and CSS for my next tracker instead and I want to add reminders, quotes, journaling section, and notifications for daily encouragement. I think to make my data analysis more advanced my app should support data export to Excel. This app is quite simple so for the future I will focus more on adding more personalised options like habit categories and other new metrics ⋆˚｡⋆୨୧˚.</p>
